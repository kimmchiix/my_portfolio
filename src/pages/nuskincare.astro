    title: "Bold Typography",
    text: "Bold typography was chosen to convey emotional clarity and confidence, which is especially important when dealing with complex feelings. Large, strong typefaces create immediate visual impact, making key messages feel assertive and unambiguous. This directness helps users—particularly young people who may feel overwhelmed—to focus on what matters emotionally. The typography also acts as a visual anchor throughout the site, grounding the user in each section’s theme. By combining expressive fonts with thoughtful layout, the text becomes not just readable, but felt.",

  {
    title: "Scrolling Effects",
    text: "Scroll-based interactions introduce a sense of narrative pacing, encouraging users to move through the content at a reflective, personal rhythm. These effects create a subtle dynamic between control and flow—mirroring how emotions are often experienced. Parallax and fade-ins allow new layers of meaning to emerge as the user progresses, keeping the experience engaging without overwhelming. For younger users accustomed to fast-scrolling environments, this intentional slowdown helps foster mindfulness and emotional awareness. Scroll effects turn passive browsing into an emotional journey.",

  {
    title: "Visual Graphics",
    text: "The visual graphics are designed to act as emotional cues—abstract shapes, textures, and color gradients help communicate moods and internal states that might be hard to put into words. This is particularly helpful for teens and young adults, who are often still learning how to identify and articulate their feelings. The graphics don’t just decorate the site; they contextualize the text, offering emotional context at a glance. Soft animations and symbolic imagery create an inviting, empathetic tone. These visuals help bridge the gap between digital experience and emotional understanding.",
